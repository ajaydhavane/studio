# **App Name**: Valentine Proposal

## Core Features:

- Valentine Question: Display a question asking 'Will you be my Valentine?'
- Evasive 'No' Button: Implement a 'No' button that moves away from the cursor, making it difficult to click.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep red (#8B0000) to represent love and passion, fitting for Valentine's Day.
- Background color: Soft pink (#FAEBD7), a very lightly saturated hue of red to create a gentle, romantic backdrop.
- Accent color: Burgundy (#800020) for highlighting the 'Yes' button.
- Font: 'Literata', a transitional serif with a literary and slightly formal feel suitable for Valentine's content.
- Use heart-shaped icons and other Valentine's Day themed symbols for visual accents.
- Center all elements on the page to create a simple and direct presentation.
- Smooth transitions and animations for the button movements and the celebratory GIF display.
